# 📈 Compound Interest Calculator

## 🌍 Overview
The **Compound Interest Calculator** is a tool that computes the future value of an investment or loan based on the initial principal, interest rate, compounding frequency, and time. It helps estimate how interest accumulates over time, considering interest earned on both the principal and previously accrued interest.

3. ⏳ Specify the number of years.
4. 💰 Enter the monthly contribution amount.
5. ✅ Get the future value and total interest earned.

## 📐 Formula Used
$$
C = C_0 \times (1 + r)^t + I \times \left( \frac{(1 + r)^t - 1}{r} \right)
$$

Where:
- \( C \) = Future value (end of period)
- \( C_0 \) = Initial capital (starting amount)
- \( r \) = Rate of return (annual interest rate, as a decimal)
- \( I \) = Annual contribution (monthly savings × 12)
- \( t \) = Number of years
